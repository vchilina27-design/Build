## Strategies

### Beginner Strategies

#### Rush Strategy
- Quickly move to a favorable position early game
- Establish control point dominance
- Maintain your position with support from teammates

**Best For**: Light and Medium tanks

#### Defensive Strategy
- Control high-ground positions
- Let enemies come to you
- Focus on armor and survivability

**Best For**: Heavy tanks and Tank Destroyers

### Intermediate Strategies

#### Flanking Maneuver
1. Identify enemy positions
2. Move around enemy lines (use terrain)
3. Attack from the side where armor is weakest
4. Retreat if overwhelmed

**Timing**: Execute when teammates engage frontally

#### Support Role
- Stay near heavy tank allies
- Focus fire on targets they're attacking
- Protect their flanks and rear
- Fall back when needed

#### Hit & Run (Skirmish)
- Quick attacks on isolated enemies
- Never stay in one position long
- Retreat and reposition constantly
- Excellent for light tanks

### Advanced Strategies

#### Armor Degradation Tactics
- Concentrate fire on one tank to break their armor
- Spread focus when armor is weakened
- Finish damaged vehicles quickly

#### Map Control
- Rotate through positions strategically
- Maintain vision of key areas
- Cut off enemy escape routes
- Control supply stations (ammo/health)

#### Team Coordination
- Establish roles (scouts, heavies, support)
- Call out enemy positions continuously
- Coordinate pushes on objectives
- Maintain formation for maximum effectiveness

### Counter Strategies

**Against Light Tanks**: Use area damage; they can't absorb hits
**Against Heavy Tanks**: Flank them; their rotation is slow
**Against Tank Destroyers**: Close the distance; they're weak in close combat
**Against Artillery**: Move constantly; they need time to aim
